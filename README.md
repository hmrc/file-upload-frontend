## Endpoints

### POST /upload

This endpoint allows the uploading of a file to the tax platform by means of the `file-upload` service.

The calling service *must* ensure that:

* an envelope was defined via the `file-upload` service and an `envelopeId` and `fileId` are registered for that envelope
* the request contains the above valid `envelopeId` and `fileId`

i.e. If being invoked from an HTML form - the service generating the form should ensure that these fields are present
and have valid values assigned by the [`file-upload` (backend) service](https://github.com/hmrc/file-upload).

This endpoint *requires*:
 
* the contentType to be defined as `multipart/form-data` with the below parameters defined alongside the actual file content.
* a single filePart be present containing the data to be uploaded to the corresponding `fileId` within the envelope.

#### Parameters
|Parameter|Required?|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`successRedirect`|Y|`http://www.tax.gov.uk/service/uploadSuccess`|*Client side* redirection - fully qualified, external URL. This is used within a 303 SEE OTHER redirect and should indicate the next page within your user journey for a successful upload outcome. NB: This will result in an HTTP `GET` of the indicated endpoint.|
|`failureRedirect`|Y|`http://www.tax.gov.uk/service/uploadFailure`|*Client side* redirection - fully qualified, external URL. This is used within a 303 SEE OTHER redirect and should indicate the next page within your user journey for a failure of upload outcome. NB: This will result in an HTTP `GET` of the indicated endpoint.|
|`envelopeId`|Y|`1234567890`|A file-upload service generated envelope identifier. This will be validated against the file-upload service so a valid envelope *must* have been created prior to invoking this endpoint|
|`fileId`|Y|`0987654321`|A file-upload service generated file identifier. This will be validated against the file-upload service so a valid envelope *must* have been created prior to invoking this endpoint|
